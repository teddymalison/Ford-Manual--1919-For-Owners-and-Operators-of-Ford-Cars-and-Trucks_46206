<p>
 Foreword


 It is a significant fact that nearly all Ford cars are driven by
 laymen--by owners, who in the great majority of cases have little
 or no practical experience with things mechanical.
 </p>
<p>
 The simplicity of the Ford car and the ease with which it
 is operated renders an intimate knowledge of mechanical
 technicalities unnecessary for its operation.
</p>
<p>
 And the further fact that there are more than twenty thousand Ford
 service stations distributed throughout the civilized world--where
 adjustments and repairs may be had with no annoying delay--gives
 to Ford owners a singular freedom from mechanical annoyances
 which beset owners of cars having limited service facilities and
 distribution.
 </p>
 <p>

 But while it is not imperative, it is, however, altogether
 desirable that every Ford owner should thoroughly understand his
 car. With such knowledge at his command he is always master of the
 situation--he will maintain his car more economically--prolong its
 usefulness--and he will also derive more pleasure from it, for it
 is a truism that the more one knows about a thing the more one
 enjoys it.
 </p>
 <p>

 The mastery of a thorough knowledge of Ford construction is by no
 means a difficult or time-consuming task. The Ford is the simplest
 car made. It is easy to understand, and is not difficult to keep
 in proper adjustment and repair.
 </p>
 <p>

 That the Ford construction may be thoroughly understood--and
 that there may be an authoritative guide for the making of Ford
 adjustments--this book is published.
 </p>

<p>
 <h2>Important</h2>

 _It is most important that owners of Ford cars shall insist upon
 getting the genuine Ford-made materials, or "Parts," when having
 repairs or replacements made. This will be assured when the car
 is taken to the authorized Ford agent. Imitation, or "bogus" or
 counterfeit parts of inferior quality are being made and sold as
 "Ford Parts." Avoid their use by dealing with the authorised Ford
 agent._
</p>

 <h2>The Car and Its Operation</h2>


<em> _What must be done before starting the Car?_ </em>        <strong>_Answer No. 1_</strong>

 Before trying to start the car, fill the radiator (by removing cap
 at top) with clean fresh water. If perfectly clean water cannot
 be obtained it is advisable to strain it through muslin or other
 similar material to prevent foreign matter from getting in and
 obstructing the small tubes of the radiator. The system will hold
 approximately three gallons. It is important that the car should
 not be run under its own power unless the water circulating system
 has been filled. Pour in the water until you are sure that both
 radiator and cylinder water jackets are full. The water will run
 out of the overflow pipe onto the ground when the entire water
 system has been properly filled. During the first few days that a
 new car is being driven it is a good plan to examine the radiator
 frequently and see that it is kept properly filled. The water
 supply should be replenished as often as may be found necessary.
 Soft rain water, when it is to be had in a clean state, is
 superior to hard water, which may contain alkalies and other salts
 which tend to deposit sediment and clog the radiator. (See chapter
 on Cooling System.)


<em> _What about Gasoline?_ </em>                              <strong>_Answer No. 2_</strong>

 The ten-gallon gasoline tank should be filled--nearly full--and
 the supply should never be allowed to get low. When filling the
 tank be sure that there are no naked flames within several feet,
 as the vapor is extremely volatile and travels rapidly. Always
 be careful about lighting matches near where gasoline has been
 spilled, as the air within a radius of several feet is permeated
 with the highly explosive vapor. The small vent hole in the
 gasoline tank cap should not be allowed to get plugged up, as
 this would prevent proper flow of the gasoline to the carburetor.
 The gasoline tank may be drained by opening the pet cock in the
 sediment bulb at the bottom.


 <em>_How about the Oiling System?_ </em>                     <strong>_Answer No. 3_</strong>

 Upon receipt of the car see that a supply of medium light,
 high-grade gas engine oil is poured into the crank case through
 the breather pipe at the front of the engine (a metal cap covers
 it). Down under the car in the flywheel casing (the reservoir
 which holds this oil) you will find two pet cocks. Pour oil in
 slowly until it runs out of the upper cock. Leave the cock open
 until it stops running--then close it. After the engine has
 become thoroughly limbered up, the best results will be obtained
 by carrying the oil at a level midway between the two cocks--but
 under no circumstances should it be allowed to get below the lower
 cock. All other parts of the car are properly oiled when it leaves
 the factory. However, it will be well to see that all grease cups
 are filled and that oil is supplied to necessary parts. (See Cut
 No. 18, also chapter on Lubrication.)


 <em>_How are Spark and Throttle Levers used?_</em>           <strong>_Answer No. 4_</strong>

Under the steering wheel are two small levers. The right-hand
(throttle) lever controls the amount of mixture (gasoline and air)
which goes into the engine. When the engine is in operation, the
farther this lever is moved downward toward the driver (referred
to as "opening the throttle") the faster the engine runs and the
greater the power furnished. The left-hand lever controls the
spark, which explodes the gas in the cylinders of the engine. The
advancing of this lever "advances the spark," and it should
be moved down notch by notch until the motor seems to reach its
maximum speed. If the lever is advanced beyond this point a dull
knock will be noticed in the engine. (See chapter on Ignition.)

 with the teeth of the gear case and center pinion. (Cut No. 1)]


<em> _Where should these levers be when starting the Engine?_</em>
                                                     <strong> _Answer No. 5_</strong>

 The spark lever should usually be put in about the third or fourth
 notch of the quadrant (the notched half-circle on which the levers
 operate). The throttle should usually be opened about five or
 six notches. A little experience will soon teach you where these
 levers should be placed for proper starting. Care should be taken
 not to advance the spark lever too far, as the engine may "back
 kick."


 <em>_What else is necessary before starting the Engine?_ </em> <strong>_Answer No. 6_</strong>

 First, see that the hand lever, which comes up through the floor
 of the car at the left of the driver, is pulled back as far as it
 will go. The lever in this position holds the clutch in neutral
 and engages the hub brake, thus preventing the car moving forward
 when the engine is started. Second, after inserting the switch key
 in the switch on the coil box, throw the switch lever as far to
 the left as it will go--to the point marked "magneto." This switch
 connects the magneto with the engine. The engine can't be started
 until it is on--and the throwing off of this switch stops the
 engine.


 <em>_How is the Engine started?_ </em>                        <strong>_Answer No. 7_</strong>

 If the car is not equipped with a starter the engine is started
 by the lifting of the starting crank at the front of the car.
 Take hold of the handle and push firmly toward the car till you
 feel the crank ratchet engage, then lift upward with a quick
 swing. With a little experience this operation wall become an
 easy matter. Don't, as a usual thing, crank downward against the
 compression--for then an early explosion may drive the handle
 vigorously backward. This does not mean however, that it is not
 advisable, when the car is hard to start, to occasionally "spin"
 the engine by the use of the starting handle--but be sure the
 spark lever is retarded when spinning or cranking the engine
 against compression, otherwise a sudden backfire may injure the
 arm of the operator. When the engine is cool it is advisable to
 prime the carburetor by pulling on the small wire at the lower
 left corner of the radiator while giving the engine two or three
 quarter turns with the starting handle.

 If the car is equipped with a starter the spark and throttle
 levers should be placed in the same position on the quadrant as
 when cranking by hand, and the ignition switch turned on. Current
 from either battery or magneto may be used for ignition. However,
 we recommend that the magneto be used at all times. The magneto
 was designed to furnish ignition for the Model T engine and
 better results will be obtained by operating in this way. Special
 attention must be paid to the position of the spark lever as a
 too advanced spark will cause serious backfiring which in turn
 will bend or break the shaft in the starter. The starting motor is
 operated by a push button, conveniently located in the floor of
 the car at the driver's feet. With the spark and throttle levers
 in the proper position, and the ignition switch turned on, press
 on the push button with the foot. This closes the circuit between
 the battery and starting motor, causing the pinion of the Bendix
 drive shaft to engage with the teeth on the flywheel, thus turning
 over the crankshaft. When the engine is cold it may be necessary
 to prime it by pulling out the carburetor priming rod, which is
 located on the instrument board. In order to avoid flooding the
 engine with an over rich mixture of gas, the priming rod should
 only be held out for a few seconds at a time.


 <em>_How is the Engine best started in cold weather?_</em>    <strong>_Answer No. 8_</strong>

 As gasoline does not vaporize readily in cold weather it is
 naturally more difficult to start the motor under such conditions.
 The usual method of starting the engine when cold is to turn
 the carburetor dash adjustment one-quarter turn to the left in
 order to allow a richer mixture of gasoline to be drawn into the
 cylinders; then hold out the priming rod, while you turn crank
 from six to eight one-quarter turns in quick succession, or turn
 the motor over a few times with the starter. Another method of
 starting a troublesome cold engine is as follows: Before you throw
 on the magneto switch, (1) close throttle lever; (2) hold out
 priming rod while you give crank several quick turns, or turn the
 motor over a few times with the starter, then let go of priming
 rod (being careful that it goes back all the way); (3) place spark
 lever in about third notch and advance throttle lever several
 notches; (4) throw on switch (being sure to get it on side marked
 "Magneto"); (5) give crank one or two turns, or close the starting
 switch, and the motor should start. After starting the motor it
 is advisable to advance the spark eight or ten notches on the
 quadrant and let the motor run until thoroughly heated up. If you
 start out with a cold motor you will not have much power and are
 liable to "stall." The advantage of turning on the switch last, or
 after priming, is that when you throw on the switch and start the
 motor, you have plenty of gas in the cylinders, to keep the motor
 running, thereby eliminating the trouble of the motor starting and
 stopping. After motor is warmed up turn carburetor adjustment back
 one-quarter turn.

 To facilitate starting many drivers make a practice of stopping
 their engine by pulling out on the priming rod, which has the
 effect of shutting off the air suction and filling the cylinders
 full of a very rich gasoline vapor. This should not be done unless
 the car is going to stand over night or long enough to cool off.
 If the motor is stopped in this way and then started when hot,
 starting is apt to be difficult on account of the surplus gasoline
 in the carburetor.
